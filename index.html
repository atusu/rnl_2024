                    <p><i>Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics — and they are mostly clever fools — seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can."</i></p>

                Despite the glowing reviews, this book was too depressing for me. The Italian award-winning Physicist author, Paolo Giordano,
                has a polished minimalist style that I admired, but the characters were, ultimately, so damaged, insular and cold that the book
                may well have been titled, "The Abject Loneliness of Dysfunctional People." [...]

                The only experience that can rival reading a really great book is reading a really awful one and ripping it on goodreads;
                especially if, like this one, it comes with glowing recommendations. Except for some of the writing (maybe),
                this book had absolutely no redeeming feature. It was one of the most depressing books I have ever read,
                with no redemption and completely non-endearing self-involved characters who were either pathetic, sadistic, or both.
